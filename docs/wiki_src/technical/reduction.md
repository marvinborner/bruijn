# Reduction

Bruijn uses the RKNL abstract machine reducer[^1]. RKNL uses the
call-by-need reduction strategy, similar to Haskell and other functional
programming languages. For you this means that you have efficient
support for [laziness](../coding/laziness.md) with generally less
redundant reductions.
