# Samples

Most of the examples are copies of our solutions on [Rosetta
Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Bruijn). All examples are
written by bruijn's contributors and may be used according to the GNU
FDL license (see `license.md`).

While solutions to the Project Euler puzzles should not be published in
general, we may provide bruijn's solutions to the first 100 puzzles for
introductory purposes. This is [tolerated by the
creators](https://projecteuler.net/about).
